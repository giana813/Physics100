# MCMC_Errors notebooks detail the process of determining the error on the position extracted through astrophotometric images. Monte Carlo Markov Chain was chosen due to the high parameter space of the orbital 
# parameters. 

# Orbit_determination.ipynb entails the code for determining the orbital parameters using the positional information returned from the previous notebook.

# complete_process.py is a script that aids with image solving, calibration, and alignment.
